Blue Diamond Version Numbers

Version numbers take the following form
=======================================

R.YY.MMDD.bbb

Where
R:   Major release number
YY:  Two digit year
MM:  Two digit Month
DD:  Two digit day
bbb: "n" digit build number

On any given day of the year you can make a build. 
Start with the current major revision, add the date, and increment the build number starting with 0
The first build on July 1, 2017 is: 1.17.0701.0
The twelfth build would be: 1.17.0701.12

Ideally if we do more than 100 builds in a day we should be automating this process so that the build numbers
prepend zeros to bring the last version segment to three digits. Normally we would not release more than 10 
builds a day.

Debug, Release and Test builds
==============================

A debug build contains debugging information and may contain paths that are designed to make the project
work well in the designer, debugger or IDE.

A release build would be a final releaed to production build designed to be installed on a client's machine

A test build would be designed to be installed on a client's machine but may still contain debugging code
and scaffolding to assist with detecting, logging, and resolving issues.
